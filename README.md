QHacks 2019 Hack: JABBIC

JABBIC harnesses the power of machine learning to recognize specific facial qualities (if you wear lots of lipstick, if you are bald, if you have a beard, if you wear glasses, etc.) and utilizes that data to provide better targeted advertisements that actually pertain to who you are as a person.

NOTE: not included in this repo are node_modules, and AutoML API information. To run this app successfully, you will need to start up an Expo app with React Native to obtain the necessary modules, download the sample dataset from Kaggle, and set up your own model with AutoML. The dataset we used and trained for this app can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset

Pictures of app coming soon.
