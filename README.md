Repo for QHacks 2019

JABBIC harnesses the power of machine learning to recognize specific facial qualities (if you wear lots of lipstick, if you are bald, if you have a beard, if you wear glasses, etc.) and utilizes that data to provide better targeted advertisements that actually pertain to who you are as a person.

NOTE: not included in this repo are node_modules. To run this app successfully, you will need to start up an Expo app with React Native.

Pictures of app coming soon.
